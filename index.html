<h2>Project 14: Evaluation of cryptography usage in IOS Vault Applications</h2>
<h4>Professor/Mentor/Guide: Dr. N.R. Sunitha, Professor, Dept. of Computer Science & Engg.,Siddaganga Institute of Technology Tumkur, Karnataka, India.</h4>
<h4> Abstract</h4>
<p>Evaluation of cryptography usage in iOS Vault applications
Abstract Mobile applications that store sensitive data need proper cryptographic measures to secure this information with a significant level of privacy. Developers embed cryptographic techniques in their applications and while cryptography experts typically handle these implementations, any misuse could lead to systematic attacks, data breaches, and information disclosure. In this paper,we study whether cryptography and related techniques are employed properly, as most applications guarantee that information obtained from users undergo an encryption process. In this project, we downloaded 30 Apple applications from the App Store and performed static and dynamic analysis to detect any possible cryptographic misuse. Finally, we will identify a list of good countermeasures for developers to alleviate the identified issues</p>

<h2>Project 10: Social Media Forensics</h2>
<h4>Professor/Mentor/Guide: Dr. S.S. Iyengar Ph.D. Graduate Student Sina Navabi.</h4>
<h4> Abstract</h4>
<p>Students will experience the development of techniques to perform buffer analysis of web 
browsers, real-time evidence collection in messaging/chats for apps such as TikTok, which are 
currently limited due to large data.</p>

<h2>Project 9: Generating an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Dataset for Security</h2>
<h4>Professor/Mentor/Guide: Dr. S.S. Iyengar Ph.D. Graduate Student Sina Navab</h4>
<h4> Abstract</h4>
<p>Students will select one of the areas below to help develop an IDS dataset.</p>
<p>A. Virtual Network Topology Using GNS3: Students should find a custom topology on the  GNS3 marketplace or design one from scratch and run it on a virtual machine. It's a benefit if they can establish routing between subnets in topology. The virtual network has  several requirements. There should be an attack subnet and a benign subnet thatcommunicate with each other via the Internet. </p>
<p>B. Finding up-to-date network exploitation codes on Github and testing them on a local environment: There are numerous repositories available on Github for network attack research. Yet, each has unique characteristics and exploits a specific target or vulnerability. Students should research these available resources and present the most up-to-date repositories to employ for further research</p>

<h2>Project 17: The quest for increased IoT security with forensics agents.
Abstract</h2>
<h4>Professor/Mentor/Guide: Dr. Pawel Sniatala, Poznan University of Technology, Dr. S.S. Iyengar (FIU) & Col Jerry Miller (FIU)</h4>
<h4> Abstract</h4>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) brings a set of unique and complex challenges to the field of digital 
forensics. To take advantage of the volume and variety of data captured by and stored in ubiquitous IoT services, forensic investigators need to draw upon evidence-acquisition methods and techniques from all areas of digital forensics and possibly create new IoT-specific investigation processes. Although a number of conceptual process models have been developed to address the unique characteristics of the IoT, many challenges remain unresolved</p>

<h2>Project 1: How to Protect Remote Connections</h2>
<h4>Professor/Mentor/Guide: Dr. Latesh Kumar KJ (FIU) </h4>
<h4> Abstract</h4>
<p>Remote computing is one of the latest trends in Enterprise IT. Unfortunately, many organizations that are adopting this new technology remain unaware as to how to properly implement the new remote desktop services hitting the market. This has led to many remote server environments being just-as, if not more, vulnerable to attack than the old environments they are supposed to replace. The project will demonstrate the exploitation of an unprotected remote server environment and acquire virtual machine data. This project will demonstrate how to protect remote connections by working with rules dumped from an IPtables firewall using the iptables-save utility, aids IPtables firewall administrators in analyzing and 
debugging firewalls.</p>
